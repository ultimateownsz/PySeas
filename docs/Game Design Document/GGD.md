## Gameplay Overview

| Gameplay Loop |  Players control a customizable ship, exploring a dynamic, modular map. They roll dice to navigate, engage in naval combat, and complete quests. Each decision shapes their journey, offering replayability and strategic depth. |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Theme Interpretation (Curse is Strenth)

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="Assets/Curses.png" alt="PyCeas" width="1000">
</div>

In PyCeas, curses are not just cosmetic effects; they serve as gameplay modifiers that add strategic depth and variety to the player's experience. Drawing inspiration from role-playing games like Pillars of Eternity 2, curses act as status effects that influences how players interact with the world, engage in combat, and make decisions.

- At the start of the game, players choose one of several available curses.
- Each curse introduces unique advantages and disadvantages, shaping the player's interactions with NPCs, quest outcomes, and dice rolls.
- Curses offer replayability by providing new challenges and oppurtunities in each playthrough.

**Example Curses:**
- **Cursed Luck:** Lower dice rolls but increased treasure rewards.
- **Burning Ambition:** Resource penalties but combat bonuses.
- **Whispering Shadows:** Distrustful NPCs but avoidance of some hostile encounters.

---

#### Concept: Dice Roll

Players could use a deck-building-inspired system to influence dice rolls, allowing for strategic decision-making alongside traditional randomness.
*Example:*
1. At the start of a turn, the player draws a dice card:
> "Roll a D8. Gain +2 movement if the result is an even number."
2. The player rolls the dice, lands a 6, and moves 8 spaces (6 + 2). The bonus triggers a hidden event, revealing a nearby NPC.


#### Concept: Virtual Book

![Gameplay Overview](Assets/UI.png)

The `Virtual Book` could act as a centralized interface for inventory, quest logs, and maps. Inspired by the Pokédex in the Pokémon series, it would provide an intuitive and seamless way for players to manage resources and track progress.

*Example Features:*
> - A page for active quests.
> - A map with uncovered tiles.
> - A list of items and ship upgrades.

#### Concept: Free Movement

During their turn, players might have the freedom to move their ship across a modular map based on dice rolls. This system could enable flexible exploration, allowing players to uncover tiles dynamically and adapt their strategy based on the environment.


#### Concept: Ship Upgrading

![Ship upgrading 2](Assets/Ship%20upgrading%202.png)

Players might start with a basic ship and gain the ability to upgrade it over time. Upgrades could provide bonuses in movement, combat, or resource management, tailored to the player’s preferred playstyle.

*Example:*
> Upgrading to a larger ship could grant access to new dice cards, faster movement, or increased inventory space.

### Secondary Mechanics

| Mechanic              | Description                                                                | Animated mock-up<br>(Art not necessarily final)                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fog of War**        | Limits visibility on the map, encouraging strategic exploration.                    | ![Fog of War](Assets/Fog%20of%20war.gif) |
| **Procedural Generation** | Randomized map layouts to ensure unique challenges and enhance replayability.                       | ![Procedural generation](Assets/Procedural%20generation.gif) |
| **World Events**      | Dynamic encounters triggered by stepping into specific map zones, similar to Pokémon’s "tall grass" mechanic.                                | ![World events](Assets/World%20event.gif) |

---

#### Concept: Fog of War

A `Fog of War` system could limit the visibility on the map, requiring players to uncover tiles as they explore. This mechanic would add a sense of mystery and strategic decision-making.
*Example Implementation:*
> Initially, all tiles are hidden under a semi-transparent layer. Players reveal adjecent tiles dynamically as they move, uncovering hidden treasures, NPCs, or hazards.

#### Concept: Procedural Generation

The map layout and resources could be `Procedurally Generated` for each playtrough, offering unique challenges and environments. This would enhance replayability by ensuring no two games are the same.
*Example Implementation:*

> Key features like ports, hazards, and treasures could follow predefined rules to maintain balance while introducing randomization for variety.

#### Concept: World Events

Dynamic `World Events` could be triggered similarly to how encounters occur in classic Pokémon games when players interact with "tall grass" or specific terrain types. These events add unpredictability and immersion as players explore the map.

*Example Implementation:*

> Stepping on a specific tile could trigger an event like a rival pirate attack, a stranded merchant, or an island discovery quest.

## Art and Immersion

### Artistic Pillars

> These pillars define PyCeas' artistic identity, focusing on the visual style and how it complements gameplay and storytelling.

1. **Dynamic Color Shifts:**
   Gameplay elements influence the environment, altering color tones to reflect changes in mood, state, or reactions. For instance:
   - A cursed area may have darker, muted tones.
   - A succesful exploration may brighten the surrounding map.
2. **Player Immersion:**
   As players interact with the environment, the dynamic visuals enhance immersion and reinforce the thematic storytelling.

3. **Interactive Environments:**
   Visual details like rippling water, flickering lanterns, or shifting shadows bring the world to life. These subtle elements respond dynamically to player actions, enhancing immersion.
4. **Clarity Through Design:**
   Clear, minimalistic visuals ensure that the game's aesthetic doesn’t compromise functionality. Every pixel serves a purpose, balancing beauty with usability.

### Design

> PyCeas’ design philosophy prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and usability. Its open-source foundation invites contributors to leave their mark on the project, ensuring a game shaped by creativity and community.

1. **Minimalism with Purpose:**
Visuals and mechanics are kept simple to enhance usability while still delivering a rich, immersive experience.

2. **Collaboration-First Approach:**
The modular design allows contributors to work on independent features (e.g., adding curses, creating new tile sets) without disrupting existing systems.

3. **Flexible Aesthetics:**
While the base art style is pixelated, contributors can experiment with complementary visual elements, such as animations or overlays, to enhance gameplay.

#### Map Design

The map will feature a modular, tile-based design created with Tiled, using 16x16 pixel assets. To optimize performance, the game will be employ chunk-based rendering, displaying only the tiles near the player (e.g. a 10x10 or 15x15 visible area). This approach allows for larger maps without performance degradation.

For the project we’ve created an initial 100x100 tile-based map using 
Tiled, providing a foundational layout for exploration and gameplay. As development progresses, this map can be expanded or modified based on gameplay needs and **community feedback**.

![Map starting point](Assets/Map.png)

## Audio

### Dynamic Soundtrack

> Help make the seas sing! PyCeas needs an adaptive soundtrack that mirrors the journey of a pirate. Composers and sound designers can craft melodies for every mood, from calm exploration to thrilling naval battles. Imagine the possibilities:
>
> - A haunting theme for cursed areas
> - Uplifting tones for discoveries and victories.
> - The rumble of cannons during battles!

<!-- A dynamic and adaptive soundtrack will accompany players as they explore the map. The music will shift in tone and intensify depending on the player’s actions and the environment, from calm and mysterious melodies while exploring uncharted waters, to intense rhythms during 
combat. -->

### Sound Effects

To enhance the experience and add polish, a variety of environmental sound effects will provide feedback and depth to the player’s actions. These sounds will be integrated throughout the game, including when using the inventory, world map, menus, settings, and more.

Initially, the game will include a limited set of key sound effects, such as dice rolls, ship movement, and cannon fire. Dynamic or adaptive soundtracks will be introduced in later development stages, using Pygame's `mixer` module for basic audio handling.

---

## Game Experience

### User Interface (UI)

The User Interface (UI) is a central mechanic in the game, designed to track all aspects of the player’s progress, including the quest log, items storage, and other key elements. The UI will be easy to use and accessible, providing players with a clear view of their in-game 
activities and resources.

The User Interface (UI) will be designed modularly, allowing incremental updates as features are implemented. Initial versions will include only core elements, such as dice rolls, movement, and basic ship management.

### Controls

The controls will include both mouse and keyboard inputs, with shortcuts for common actions such as rolling dice, interacting with the map, or accessing the inventory.

**Mouse:**
- Left click: primary interaction method for navigating the UI and 
interacting with game elements.

**Keyboard:**
- Special keys: for interacting with the map, accessing the inventory 
or instantly focussing on the player.
