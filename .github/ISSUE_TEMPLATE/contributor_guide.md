## Proposal or Task Description

**What should you do here?**
- Briefly describe what you want to work on.
- Explain the feature, bug fix, or improvement you’d like to address.

**Example:**
> I noticed that the player movement in the game feels a bit laggy. I’d like to optimize the movement by adjusting the way we calculate position updates.

## Questions or Feedback Needed

**What should you do here?**
- List any questions or concerns you have.
- Ask for specific feedback from maintainers if needed.

**Example:**

## Resources or Context

**What should you do here?**
- Share links, code snippets, or other information that will help others understand your idea.
- Provide paths to related files or documentation.

**Example:**
- Code snippet: `/player_movement.py` line 45.
