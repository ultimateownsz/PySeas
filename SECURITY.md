## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Here's how:

1. **Email us directly:**
    We use **ProtonMail**, a secure, privacy-focues email provider, to handle all security communications. Your messages are encryped in transit for added privacy.
    Send a detailed report to our security team at [Pyseasproject@proton.me](mailto:Pyseasproject@proton.me).

   **What to incluce:**
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reporoduce the issue.
   - Any relevant information (e.g., logs, screenshots, or code snippets).
  
2. **Use GitHub Security Advisories:**
   If you prefer not to use email, you can report vulnerabilies privately through GitHub's built-in [Security Advisories](https://github.com/ultimateownsz/PySeas/security/advisories/new).

> **Optional:** For extra privacy, you may encrypt your email using our public PGB key. [Download PGB key](docs/pyseas_public.asc)

### Including Visual Proof (Optional)

If possible, include a GIF or short video to visually demonstrate the vulnerability. This can help us quickly understand and address the issue.

**Recommended Tools:**

- **[LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/):** Free tool for creating GIFs on Windows and macOS.
- **[Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek):** A Linux-friendly alternative.

> Tip: When creating a GIF, make sure to capture clear steps showing the issue. Limit sensitive data (e.g., API keys or passwords) in your recordings.

## Response Time

- **Acknowledgment:** We will confirm receipt of your report within **48 hours**.
- **Resolution Plan:** We will work to investigate, fix, and test the issue promptly.

---

## Public Disclosure Policy

- Vulnerabilities will **not** be disclosed publicly until a fix is implemented.
- Coordinated disclosure with the reporter will be prioritized.
- Fixes will be communicated in release notes or through a GitHub security advisory.

## Examples of Vulnerabilities to Report

Please report:
- Issues that could compromise data security, user privacy, or project integrity.
- Authentication, authorization, or privilege escalation flaws.
- Code injection, buffer overflows, or similar exploits.

Please **do not** report:
- General bugs (use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ultimateownsz/PySeas/issues)).
- Feature requests (use [our enhancement template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user_story_issue_template.md)).
